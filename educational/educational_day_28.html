            <div class="section">
                <p>For many customers, hidden commissions have led to overpayments on car finance agreementsâ€”but what happens if you don't take action? Here's why it's important to consider the cost of doing nothing.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h3>A Potential Deadline to Keep in Mind</h3>
                <p>While the exact deadlines for motor finance claims have not yet been set, it's worth noting that during the PPI claims scandal, billions of pounds went unclaimed because customers missed the deadline. In total, over Â£10 billion in PPI compensation was left unrecovered.</p>
                <p>Don't let history repeat itselfâ€”taking action now ensures your case is prepared and submitted well before any potential cut-off dates.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h3>What's at Stake?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Your Money:</strong> On average, claims for hidden commissions are worth Â£2,148*. That's money that could be in your pocket, helping to ease your financial burden or pay for something important.</li>
                    <li><strong>Missed Opportunities:</strong> With the FCA estimating that 99% of motor finance agreements involve commissions, there's a high chance your agreement could be affected. Not pursuing your claim means potentially leaving behind what's rightfully yours.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Taking action isn't just about compensation; it's about holding lenders accountable for unfair practices. By claiming, you contribute to creating a fairer system for everyone.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h3>The Value of Acting Now</h3>
                <p>Delaying your claim could mean losing out. With lenders already preparing funds for compensation and regulatory deadlines approaching, it's important to ensure your case is reviewed and submitted on time.</p>
