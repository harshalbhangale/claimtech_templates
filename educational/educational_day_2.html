            <h1 class="title">When the FCA found out you we're being overcharged!</h1>
            
            <p>In 2019, the FCA uncovered widespread issues in the motor finance industry, revealing how hidden commissions had inflated costs for customers. This investigation highlighted practices that led many to unknowingly pay more for their car finance agreements.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>The FCA Investigation</h3>
                <p>The FCA’s investigation revealed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inflated Interest Rates:</strong> Brokers often increased interest rates to earn larger commissions, significantly raising costs for customers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Transparency:</strong> Key details about these commissions were hidden behind vague terms like, “We may receive a commission.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Inadequate Affordability Checks:</strong> In some cases, lenders failed to properly assess whether customers could afford the agreements, prioritizing profits over fairness.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>What Changed?</h3>
                <p>In January 2021, the FCA banned discretionary commission agreements (DCAs) to put an end to these unfair practices. While this was a significant step forward, many customers had already overpaid on their agreements.</p>
                <p>To address this, the FCA is developing a redress scheme aimed at helping affected customers recover the money they overpaid and holding lenders accountable for past practices.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>What This Means for You</h3>
                <p>The FCA estimates that 99% of motor finance agreements involve some form of commission. If you financed a car in recent years, it’s possible that these unfair practices impacted you. On average, affected customers have been able to reclaim £2,148*, though this amount can vary based on the specifics of each agreement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Understanding the Process</h3>
                <p>The FCA’s work ensures that lenders must now follow strict rules to prevent such issues in the future. However, identifying and addressing past unfair agreements often requires reviewing finance contracts in detail and understanding how commissions were structured.</p>
                <p>If your agreement included hidden commissions, this could be your opportunity to recover what you overpaid and ensure fairness moving forward.</p>
